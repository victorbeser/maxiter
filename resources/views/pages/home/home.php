                                    <p> Maxiter is an intuitive PHP framework designed for seamless platform
                                        development, allowing you to build robust applications with remarkable
                                        efficiency. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just embarking on your
                                        coding journey, Maxiter provides a straightforward yet powerful foundation for
                                        your projects. </p>
                                    <p> To facilitate your development process, we've included a basic template to
                                        kickstart your work. However, we encourage you to explore your creativity by
                                        customizing this template or even creating a new one from scratch. The
                                        flexibility offered by Maxiter empowers you to tailor the user experience to
                                        your specific needs, ensuring that your platform stands out. </p>
                                    <p> To modify an existing template or create a new one, navigate to the
                                        <strong>resources/views/</strong> directory. This is where the magic begins.
                                        Inside this folder, you will find the <strong>pages/</strong> subdirectory,
                                        which is crucial for your projectâ€™s structure. It is essential to organize your
                                        content effectively to take full advantage of our streamlined routing system.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> For optimal organization, ensure that all your view files are placed within the
                                        <strong>resources/views/pages/</strong> folder. The naming convention we
                                        recommend follows the structure of
                                        <strong>/pages/{pageName}/{pageName}.php</strong>. For instance, if you are
                                        developing a homepage, it should be located at
                                        <strong>/pages/home/home.php</strong>. Similarly, for a login page, use
                                        <strong>/pages/login/login.php</strong>. Adhering to this format allows our
                                        routing system to seamlessly recognize and manage your views.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> As you delve into your project, consider the various elements that will enhance
                                        user engagement and functionality. From integrating responsive design principles
                                        to implementing dynamic features, the possibilities are endless. Maxiter is
                                        equipped with the tools you need to create a modern, user-friendly interface
                                        that captivates your audience. </p>
